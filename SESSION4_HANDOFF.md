# Session 4 Handoff Documentation - noise-mobile-rust

**Date**: July 14, 2025  
**Session Duration**: ~2 hours  
**Starting Point**: Core library complete with 54 tests passing (26 unit + 28 from Session 3)  
**Ending Point**: Fully complete project with benchmarks and platform examples

## Critical Context for Next Agent

This is the **FINAL SESSION** where we completed all remaining tasks for the noise-mobile-rust project. The library is now 100% feature-complete and production-ready.

**IMPORTANT**: The library uses `snow = "0.10.0-beta.2"` from crates.io (NOT a local path).

## What Was Accomplished in Session 4

### 1. Performance Benchmarks âœ…

Created comprehensive benchmarks using Criterion (`benches/noise_benchmarks.rs`):

**Benchmark Groups**:
1. `noise_xx_handshake` - Full handshake timing (~390Î¼s)
2. `noise_xx_handshake_with_payload` - Handshake with data (~387Î¼s)
3. `encryption_throughput` - Various message sizes (270-572 MiB/s)
4. `decryption_throughput` - Includes authentication (125-287 MiB/s)
5. `batch_vs_individual` - Batch processing benefits (up to 30% improvement)
6. `resilient_session` - Replay protection overhead (~400-700ns)
7. `session_creation` - Session initialization (~2-3Î¼s)
8. `ffi_overhead` - FFI boundary cost (~50-100ns)

**Key Results**:
- Handshake: **~390Î¼s** (25x faster than 10ms target)
- Encryption: **270-572 MiB/s** (27-57x faster than 10MB/s target)
- All performance targets exceeded significantly

**Important Fix**: Had to fix decryption benchmarks because Noise requires in-order message decryption (even with sequence numbers).

### 2. iOS Integration Example âœ…

Created complete iOS example in `examples/ios/`:

**Components**:
- `NoiseSession.swift` - High-level Swift wrapper around C API
- `BLENoiseTransport.swift` - Complete BLE transport implementation
- `ExampleApp.swift` - SwiftUI demo app with initiator/responder modes
- `Package.swift` - Swift Package Manager configuration
- `NoiseMobile-Bridging-Header.h` - C bridging header
- `README.md` - Comprehensive integration guide
- `setup.sh` - Setup script for easy configuration

**Features**:
- Full Noise protocol support in idiomatic Swift
- BLE P2P communication with automatic discovery
- Error handling with typed Swift errors
- Memory management with automatic cleanup
- Support for iOS 15+ with modern Swift patterns

### 3. Android Integration Example âœ…

Created complete Android example in `examples/android/`:

**Components**:
- `NoiseSession.kt` - Kotlin wrapper with exception handling
- `noise_jni.c` - JNI bridge implementation (634 lines)
- `BLENoiseTransport.kt` - BLE transport with coroutines
- `MainActivity.kt` - UI with Material Design
- Full Gradle project structure
- `CMakeLists.txt` for native code building
- `README.md` - Complete integration guide
- `setup.sh` - Setup script with dependency checks

**Features**:
- Type-safe Kotlin API with sealed exceptions
- Comprehensive JNI bridge with error tracking
- BLE support for Android 5.0+ (API 21+)
- Automatic permission handling
- Material Design UI components

### 4. Additional Files Created

1. **BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md** - Detailed performance analysis with tables
2. **PROJECT_COMPLETE.md** - Final project summary and achievements
3. **Modified files**:
   - `Cargo.toml` - Added bench configuration
   - `src/ffi/c_api.rs` - Exported FFI constants for benchmarks

## Technical Details and Gotchas

### 1. Benchmark Implementation Issues

**Problem**: Initial benchmark for decryption failed with `Snow(Decrypt)` error.

**Root Cause**: Noise protocol requires messages to be decrypted in order, even though we implement sequence numbers for replay protection.

**Solution**: Modified decryption benchmark to create fresh session pairs for each iteration instead of pre-encrypting messages.

### 2. FFI Constants Export

Had to add public constants to `src/ffi/c_api.rs`:
```rust
pub const NOISE_MODE_INITIATOR: c_int = 0;
pub const NOISE_MODE_RESPONDER: c_int = 1;
pub const NOISE_ERROR_SUCCESS: c_int = 0;
// ... etc
```

These are needed for the benchmarks to test FFI overhead.

### 3. iOS Example Structure

- Uses Swift Package Manager with binary target
- XCFramework path: `../../target/NoiseMobile.xcframework`
- Requires Info.plist entries for BLE permissions
- BLE implementation uses length-prefixed message framing

### 4. Android JNI Complexity

The JNI bridge (`noise_jni.c`) includes:
- Session wrapper struct to track last error per session
- JNI_OnLoad/OnUnload for caching Java references
- Careful memory management with Get/ReleaseByteArrayElements
- Helper functions for creating Java byte arrays

### 5. Platform-Specific Build Requirements

**iOS**:
- Requires Xcode and `xcodebuild` command
- Uses `lipo` for universal binaries
- Creates XCFramework for distribution

**Android**:
- Requires Android SDK/NDK
- Uses `cargo-ndk` for cross-compilation
- CMake 3.22.1+ for native builds
- Targets 4 architectures: arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, x86, x86_64

## Current Project State

### Final Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 54 (all passing)
- **Lines of Code**: ~8,000 (including tests and examples)
- **Platforms**: iOS (Universal) + Android (All architectures)
- **Performance**: Exceeds all targets by 25-57x
- **Documentation**: Complete across all components

### Git Status
