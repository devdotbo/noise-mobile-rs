# Handoff Summary for noise-mobile-rust

## Quick Status
- **Core Functionality**: âœ… COMPLETE AND TESTED
- **FFI Layer**: âœ… COMPLETE AND TESTED
- **Mobile Features**: ðŸš§ PARTIALLY COMPLETE
- **Tests**: 13/13 PASSING
- **Ready for**: Basic integration, needs remaining features for production

## What Works Now
1. Full Noise XX handshake
2. Encryption/decryption after handshake
3. Complete C API for iOS/Android
4. Memory-safe key storage (in-memory only)
5. All core functionality tested

## Key Files for Next Agent
1. **CURRENT_STATUS.md** - Detailed implementation status
2. **TODO.md** - Remaining tasks with implementation guidance
3. **IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md** - Technical details and patterns
4. **CLAUDE.md** - Updated with current status

## Most Important Next Steps
1. Implement `ResilientSession` for replay protection
2. Implement `BatchedCrypto` for battery efficiency
3. Add FFI boundary tests
4. Create build scripts for iOS/Android

## Commands to Get Started
```bash
# Run all tests (should see 13 passing)
cargo test

# Check compilation
cargo check

# Build release version
cargo build --release

# View recent commits
git log --oneline -10
```

## Technical Decisions Made
1. Using snow 0.10.0-beta.2 from crates.io (not local path)
2. Three-state model for safe state transitions
3. Helper functions for all FFI operations
4. No panics in FFI layer
5. Comprehensive zeroization of sensitive data

## What's NOT Implemented
- Platform-specific key storage (iOS Keychain, Android Keystore)
- Network resilience features
- Battery optimization features
- Integration examples
- Build scripts
- CI/CD setup

The library is functional and can perform Noise handshakes and encryption. It needs the remaining features for production mobile use.
